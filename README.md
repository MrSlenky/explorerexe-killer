# Explorer.exe Killer
Simple .bat script that kills and starts explorer.exe (Useful when explorer.exe hangs or doesn't start.)


## How does it work?

This script kills and starts your explorer.exe so you don't have to restart your computer incase something fails.

## Okay, but how does it work?

Just double click the "expfix.bat" file and wait... It's that simple.
